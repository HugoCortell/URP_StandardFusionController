# URP_StandardFusionController
A multiplayer-ready first-person character controller for Unity's URP!

It is a modified version of the third-person controller, but made to work in first person whilst still rendering a fully skinned mesh.
This is accomplished via URP's camera stacking, basically, it clips player models more than it does other objects, avoiding issues with clipping through walls.
